# AITextJury

**A jury of AI-text detectors. You are the judge.**

AITextJury is an open workbench for AI-generated text detection — not
"yet another AI detector" that prints one unreliable percentage. Paste text,
run *many* independent detection methods side by side through one unified
**Detector API**, and look at the underlying evidence — per-sentence
heatmaps, surprisal, cross-model agreement, stylometric fingerprint,
calibration quality — before forming any opinion. Each detector is a juror
that presents its evidence; the verdict is yours. Think of it as a
VirusTotal-style workbench for AI-generated text: anyone can write a
detector plugin, plug it in, and compare methods openly.

```

## Quickstart

Requires [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and Node 18+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YiCQi/AITextJury.git
cd AITextJury

# Windows (PowerShell)
scripts\setup.ps1 -Ml     # one-time: private venv + all deps incl. torch
scripts\dev.ps1           # workbench at http://localhost:5173, API at :8000

# Linux / macOS
./scripts/setup.sh --with-ml
./scripts/dev.sh
```

* **Why the flag**: without `-Ml` / `--with-ml` you get a light install (no
  torch) and the four LM-based detectors stay `unavailable` — each shows the
  fix command on its panel card. Re-running setup with the flag is safe
  (the venv is reused). GPT-2-family weights (~0.5–2 GB) download on first
  analysis; if HuggingFace is blocked, set `HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com`
  first. After that everything runs offline.
* **Docker** (no Python/Node needed, torch included):
  `docker compose up` → http://localhost:8000
* Got `ModuleNotFoundError: fastapi`? You ran Python outside the venv — use
  the dev script, or activate `apps/api/.venv` first.

## Using the workbench

Paste text in the **Workbench** tab, tick detectors, hit **Analyze**, then
read the page top-to-bottom:

1. **Consensus** — the calibration-weighted vote across detectors. When
   detectors disagree, the notes say who said what; disagreement is
   information, not a bug.
2. **Detector cards** — every `score` is normalized so **higher = more
   AI**, always. Raw values keep their native direction and each card
   states it (e.g. *Binoculars: raw 6.4, lower = AI*).
3. **Heatmap** — which *parts* of the text look AI, per sentence/paragraph.
4. **Evidence chips** — the quotable numbers behind the verdict:
   perplexity, burstiness, stock-phrase hits…

The other tabs:

* **Providers** — paste any OpenAI-compatible or Gemini key (DeepSeek,
  OpenRouter, local Ollama — even keyless) to enable the **LLM Judge**.
  Keys stay in the local `data/providers.json`, masked on screen.
* **Calibration** — drop labeled samples into `data/bench/*.jsonl`
  (`{"text": ..., "label": 1}` AI / `0` human) and hit **Recalibrate**:
  each detector gets an honest AUC / accuracy, and consensus weights
  follow measured quality.
* **Methodology** — what each detector measures and what it is blind to.

There is also a CLI with the same engine:

```bash
python -m aitextjury.cli analyze article.txt -d stylometry -o report.json
python -m aitextjury.cli calibrate -d stylometry --dataset demo
```

> Privacy: everything except the LLM Judge runs **on your machine** — text,
> history and keys never leave it. Point the Judge at a local Ollama/vLLM
> and AITextJury is fully offline.

## The detector panel

| detector | type | needs | idea |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Stylometry** | local stats | nothing | burstiness, repetition profile, connective boilerplate, LLM-register "tells" (EN+ZH) |
| **LLM Perplexity** | local LM | torch+transformers | mean per-token surprisal under a small causal LM (default gpt2, configurable) |
| **Fast-DetectGPT** | local LM | torch+transformers | conditional probability curvature via contrastive perturbation ([Bao et al., ICLR'24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05130)) — documented variant |
| **Binoculars** | local LM pair | torch+transformers | performer/observer cross-model agreement ([Hans et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12070)) — documented closed form |
| **HF Classifier** | BYOM | torch+transformers | any HuggingFace text-classification model you choose |
| **LLM Judge** | BYOK | a provider key or local Ollama | your LLM judges with a strict-JSON protocol, flags paragraphs, explains |
| **Plugins** | community | anything | e.g. the bundled `length_rhythm` example (30 lines) |

Every result shows normalized score, raw statistic (+ direction), verdict,
threshold, signals, evidence, and **calibration status** — or an honest
error message.

## BYOK — your keys, your machine

OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Groq, keyless local Ollama, or any
OpenAI-compatible endpoint (vLLM, LM Studio, …). Keys live only in the
local `data/providers.json`, are sent only to the endpoint you configure,
never echoed back unmasked, and fall back to the provider's env var
(`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, …) when empty. Details:
[docs/BYOK.md](docs/BYOK.md).

## Calibration — the honesty engine

Out of the box, detectors run on documented **default bands** and are
visibly flagged `uncalibrated`. Fit them on labeled data (UI button or
`POST /api/calibration/run`) and each detector reports **AUC / accuracy /
ECE / Brier** while consensus weights detectors by measured accuracy. The
bundled demo set is a *demo* — calibrate on data from your own domain.

## Plugins — anyone can add a detector

```python
# data/plugins/my_detector.py  (or plugins/ for bundled examples)
from aitextjury.detectors.base import BaseDetector, RawOutcome
from aitextjury.schemas import Availability

class MyDetector(BaseDetector):
    id, name, family, description, DEFAULT_BANDS = ...  # see docs/DETECTOR_API.md

    def availability(self, ctx=None):
        return Availability(ok=True)

    async def analyze(self, ctx):
        ...                      # ctx.text, ctx.segmentation, ctx.providers…
        return RawOutcome(raw_score=..., raw_direction="higher_is_ai",
                          signals={...}, segment_scores=[...],
                          evidence=[EvidenceItem(title=…, detail=…)])

def register(registry):
    registry.register(MyDetector())
```

Restart the API — your detector appears in the UI with calibration, caching
and consensus treated identically to built-ins. Full contract:

## Honest limitations

* **Adversarial text defeats detectors.** Rewritten, paraphrased or
  human-edited AI text and heavily-polished human text genuinely overlap.
  AITextJury surfaces evidence and lets humans decide — it must not be
  used as proof, or to accuse students/authors.
* Local-LM detectors default to small English-centric models (`gpt2`); for
  Chinese/other languages point them at multilingual models (e.g.
  `Qwen2.5-0.5B`) via detector settings.
* Scores are probabilities only as far as their calibration says (that's
  why calibration status is displayed everywhere).
